Q1. Write a program to accept two numbers from “stdin” and find all the odd as well as even numbers present in between them.?
A1 PROGRAM
import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {
	
public static void main(String args[])
{
	StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
		StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer();
		Scanner sc =new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b =sc.nextInt();
		for (int i = a; i <=b; i++) {
			if(i%2==0)
			{
				sb.append(i);
				sb.append(" ");
			}
			else
			{
				sb1.append(i);
				sb1.append(" ");
			}
		}
		System.out.println("The even number are");
		System.out.println(sb.toString());
		System.out.println("The odd number are");
		System.out.println(sb1.toString());
	}

}
Q2.Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked for the reason, Joe said that she was unable to complete the task given to her
by her teacher. The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the number entered from “stdin”. 
A2. PROGRAM
import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {
	
public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Input");
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Output");
		for (int i = 1; i <=10; i++) {
			System.out.println(a+"x"+i+"="+i*a);
			
		}
	}

}
Q3.Write a program consisting the method “sum()” and demonstrate the concept of method overloading using this method.
A3
PROGRAM

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {
	public static void sum(int a , int b)
    {
         System.out.println(a+b);
         
    }
    public static void  sum(String s ,String s1)  
    {
    	String s4 = s+s1;
         System.out.println(s4);
    }
	
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		String s = sc.next();
		String s4 = sc.next();
		sum(a,b);//sum with integer type as input
		sum(s,s4);//	sum with String type as input
		}
	}
